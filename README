General information
-------------------

htmlArea is a WYSIWYG editor replacement for any <textarea> field. Instead
of teaching your software users how to code basic HTML to format their
content, they can use htmlArea to:

    o Format text to be bold, italicized, or underlined.
    o Change the face, size and colour.
    o Left, centre, or right-justify paragraphs.
    o Make bulleted or numbered lists.
    o Indent or un-indent paragraphs
    o Insert a horizontal line.
    o Insert hyperlinks and images.
    o Insert tables
    o View the raw HTML source of what they're editing.

You can also create your own buttons to insert custom blocks of HTML code
and images.

htmlArea is provided by interactivetools.com completely free.

Please note: because htmlArea is available for free, we can't provide
any support. Post a question to our Forum if you're having a problem
and someone may be able to help you there.
